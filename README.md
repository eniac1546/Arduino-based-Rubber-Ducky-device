# Arduino-based-Rubber-Ducky-device
The USB Rubber Ducky is a keystroke injection tool disguised as a generic flash drive. Computers recognize it as a regular keyboard and accept pre-programmed keystroke payloads at over 1000 words per minute.this device is highly used by professional hackers and ethical hackers to bypass the security of a physical system.

For this project we can use either arduino pro mini or arduino leonardo.

The arduino work as a HID or human inteface device such as mouse keyboard or any other peripheral component.So we can use the arduino leonardo as a HID device to bypass the security of a physical system such as any pc or laptop or any server.

This source code of the project will only work for the arduino pro mini or arduino leonardo.as the other arduino device doesn't compatible with the arduino keyboard library.

We need to get auto access to the keyboard.

The source code is quite simple to understand as I have just imported the keyboard library and type windows+R key which means that the run window will automatically open once the device get connected to the target system.

Once the run menu gets open we can type anything and execute the command. the command will get executed without any interruption of the user. even the firewall or the anti virus cant block the execution.

all though the attack is not that potentially harmfull. but jsut for fun you can do this.

We can even launch advance attacks using the device
